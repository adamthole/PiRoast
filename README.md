This project is for controlling a Fresh Roast SR-700 coffee roaster on a Raspberry Pi with an external SPI based thermocouple.

This project is not currently ready for general use, and is published currently only to help other developers.

Note that this project was done in Python (as opposed to another language) to force myself to become more familiar with Python.  Code may not reflect Python best practices, but I'm always willing to learn, so please contact me with suggestions for improvement.
